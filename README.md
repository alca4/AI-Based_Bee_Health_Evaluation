# Bee-Project


Bees pollinate over 80% of plants, but bee colonies have been experiencing a devastating 39.7% annual loss over the past 11 years. 

To address this pressing issue, I collected the paired data from 25 beehives in 3 apiaries in California, resulting in 4 datasets with 9,354 
high-quality records. BeeWell, an innovative end-to-end deep learning-based system was developed. This end-to-end solution includes 

1. Data acquisition and annotation for model development 
2. Bee object detection to detect bee presence in images and audio clips
3. Bee health assessment to assess bee health in images and audio clips
4. Multi-modal Visual-Audio Deep Neural Network to combine both visual and audio signals to assess beehivesâ€™ health
5. Web app deployment with near real-time streaming and bee health classification

The system is the first to integrate bee health assessment with bee object detection using paired image and audio data in research.
